This project implements a simple **Spam Email Classifier** using **scikit-learn**'s `MultinomialNB` model and `CountVectorizer`. 
It uses a dataset of labeled emails to train a model that can distinguish between spam and non-spam (ham) messages.

## Features
- Text preprocessing with **CountVectorizer**
- Machine learning using **Multinomial Naive Bayes**
- Accuracy and classification report evaluation
- Custom email input for prediction

---

##  Dataset
The dataset should be a CSV file with at least two columns:
- `text`: The email content
- `label`: The corresponding label (0 = Not Spam, 1 = Spam)


## Bash
python spam_classifier.py
